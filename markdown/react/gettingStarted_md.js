## Getting started
In this lesson, i'll teach you how to get started using React. You'll learn how to install \`create-react-app\`, Facebook's official project starter for React. I'll explain some of the basics about React and how to write and preview your application in development mode, and i'm also gonna show you how to create a production build of your application that you can host using any static hosting service like GitHub pages or Heroku.

### Prerequisites
In order to understand React and be able to work with it, first you have to make sure you're familiar with a few other technologies that are used along with the React library itself. With that in mind, i would suggest you to continue this tutorial *only* if you meet the following criteria:

- You're confident enough writing HTML and CSS.
- You know the basics of JavaScript ES6 &ndash; *let, const, arrow functions, etc.*
- You're familiar with the Document Object Model (*DOM*). You understand it's structure and know how to listen and respond to DOM events.

If you're good with these requirements, then let's keep going. Otherwise, you might wanna practice these concepts a little more. If you need help learning HTML, CSS, ES6+, or any other JavaScript topic, i suggest giving a look at the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), Mozilla's official documentation for many web technologies.
